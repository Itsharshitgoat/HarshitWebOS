# Harshit WebOS
Hey everyone, I'm Harshit. Here, I proudly present to you my masterpiece, the Harshit WebOS v1.0

## How to Use
Harshit WebOS will have a loading screen, and after that, it will start the whole thing. A welcome.txt will appear. It can be later accesed via the 'File Nest' app. To open an app, you could just click on one and it'll open. And to open files you can double click them in the file explorer.

### Easter Egg
If you switch your settings in the Tweak app to year to 2007, you'll see some errors and then you'll be greeted with fireworks and an end screen. The idea of this is from the Harshit WebOS bug, also the name of this webOS.

## Project Desc
**Harshit WebOS** is a cool webOS I made.I've chosen track 2 and a more... aesthetic retro theme? Well, the colors a customizable in the settings and it is pretty nice tbh. Note that there are still some bugs though.
